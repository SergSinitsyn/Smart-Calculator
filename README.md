## Description
- The program is developed in C++17 within the MyNamespace namespace.
- The code follows the Google Style guide.
- Full unit test coverage is prepared using the GTest library for expression calculation modules.
- The graphical interface implementation is based on the Qt library.
- The program is implemented using the MVC pattern.

### Engineer Calculator
- Accepts both integer and floating-point numbers as input.
- Input is done via keyboard and buttons in the application.
- Users can input up to 255 characters.
- Invalid input is allowed.
- Error will be displayed after pressing the = symbol for invalid input.
- Calculation is performed after complete input of the expression and pressing the = symbol.
- Supports the calculation of arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with the substitution of the variable x as a number.
- Supports various arithmetic operations and mathematical functions.
